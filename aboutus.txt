-Second Intro-
Thrifting is the quality of using money and other resources carefully and not wastefully. ThriftyCulture was founded by Shandukani Radzilsni (someone who has a general interest in fashion with a unique taste in clothing) in his final year of high school in 2023. The idea came about when he realized that there was a demand for the type of clothing he was wearing – most of which were vintage items.
The initial business model was selling these through the ThriftyCulture Instagram page until the website was launched in 2024. ThriftyCulture is for people with a timeless style who are looking for value for money. It is a place to find affordable clothing you can’t find anywhere else.
